# Plotter
### Simple app that takes values from SerialPort and plots them in real time.

Data sent for plotting should be in the following format: `Label = value\n`. (**must include newline**)

To send multiple values, format should be: `Label1 = value1; Label2 = value2; Label3 = value3\n`.
The labels will be automatically be parsed and added as titles for each plot.
If, for example, values are sent every 100ms, the frequency should be specified to 0,1 in the spinBox right below the chart, because the time Axis is generated by the app.

The terminal page (second image) features a console to see the raw received data and and send data to the other device.
